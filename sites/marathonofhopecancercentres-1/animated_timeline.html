          <h2>PILOT PHASE UNDERWAY</h2>
          <div class="divider"></div>

          <p>The Terry Fox Research Institute is implementing a
sequential number of pilot projects to develop
precision medicine programs and systems for sharing
data. The first of these pilots was launched in April
2017. Working with BC Cancer and the Princess
Margaret Cancer Centre, this pilot has a $12-million
budget over 2 years. The self-funded pilot project is
focused upon clinical genomics, immunotherapy,
imaging and information technology linkages. The
second pilot will develop a Montreal, Quebec Cancer
Consortium with four major hospitals and two
universities, which will be reviewed and launched in the
first half of 2018. The third and fourth pilots will follow
in the Atlantic and Prairie provinces with launches in
late 2018 and 2019</p>

          <h2>MARATHON OF HOPE CANCER CENTRE -
DESIGNATION PROCESS RELEASED</h2>
          <div class="divider"></div>
          <p>The Terry Fox Research Institute intends to launch its
designation program for Cancer Centres in 2018. The
designation process will be published, and Centres
will be invited to apply based on their capacity and
performance in precision oncology as evaluated by
international peers. The Terry Fox Research Institute
intends to establish at least 5 Marathon of Hope
Cancer Centres or Consortia across Canada.</p>

CENTRE - OFFICIAL DESIGNATIONS</h2>
          <div class="divider"></div>

          <p>Working in collaboration with its partners to apply the
learnings and outcomes from the pilots, including
technology solutions and best practices for data
sharing, the Terry Fox Research Institute will designate
the first Marathon of Hope Cancer Centres in 2018 and
2019. It is anticipated that these Centres will be in
British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec. The Terry Fox
Research Institute will designate Marathon of Hope
Cancer Consortia in the Atlantic and Prairie provinces
in 2019 and 2020. In addition, the Terry Fox Research
Institute will seek to designate a Marathon of Hope
program in pediatric cancers. All the centres will be
working together to create Canadaâ€™s largest cancer
genome database, containing 100,000 cancer
genomes with related treatment and outcome data.</p>
